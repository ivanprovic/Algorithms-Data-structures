/* 
prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that can only be divided
evenly by 1 and itself. Write a program that asks the user to enter
a number 0 through 9 (inclusive).
If the user enters a number within this range that is prime (2, 3, 5, or 7),
print “The digit is prime”. Otherwise, print “The digit is not prime”.
